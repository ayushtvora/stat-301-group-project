    "The question that we plan to answer is, **Which metrics are most relavent for determining the overall score of a University**. Along with statistical methods to answer this, we will be looking at current research in this topic to see what others have to say on the matter. One paper that will be referred to is \"A Critical Review on World University Ranking in Terms of Top Four Ranking Systems\" by Anowar et al. This paper covers four of the most common ranking systems of universities around the world, and analyzes some of the most common metrics used by these ranking systems. The second paper is \"University ranking using research, educational and environmental indicators\" by Lukman et al. who try to find correlations between different ranking tables and their scores in other metrics."

    "Most of the variables selected in this model have low vif values indicating there is no issue of multicollinearity. However, `teaching_score` and `reasearch_score` both have high vif values which point to multicollinearity. Despite the high multicollinearity, the model could still be effective since lasso regression includeds variables that have high multicollinearity if they contribute significantly to the model. To verify the effectiveness of the model, we will fit an oridinary least squares model with the lasso selected variables and evaluate the $R^2$ value to determine the models effectiveness. To fit the OLS we will use the testing data which was kept separate from the training process as it provides an unbiased evaluation when comparing different models and a measure of how well the model does on unseen data.

    "The adjusted $R^2$ in the full model is the same as the model with the lasso selected variables which implies that both the full model and model with lasso selected variables explain the variance `overall_score` equally than the model with both of the $R^2$ being 1. The $R^2$ being 1 implies that both models perfectly explain the variance of `overall_score`. Since the $R^2$ between the full model and lasso model was relatively the same, it justifies the variables selected with the lasso model since it implies that the variables removed did not make a significant impact to the models ability to explain the variance in `overall_score`. This result is also consistent with the result of the $p$-values in the full model as the variables that were removed in the lasso regression are also shown as insignificant in the full model."

    "Looking at the model above, it appears that the most important metrics for determining a university's overall score is their specific scores in other metrics, including teaching, research, citations, industry income, and international outlook. Other metrics such as the number of students per staff, male to female ratio, and international student rate are less important here. Using the model formula above, we can also determine which of the scores are most important for determining a university's overall score. Research score seems to be the most important, followed by teaching score, citation score, international outlook score, and finally industry income score."

    "The information collected here aligns with current research on the topic as well. When looking at the paper by Lukman et al. mentioned above, they conclude that three of the primary indicators of university rankings include, in order of priority, research performance, educational performance, and environmental performance. Although we do not have an environmental score in our model, we can see that they also see that a stronger prowess in research is correlated to a higher overall ranking, compared to a stronger teaching score."

    "The paper by Anowar et al. mentioned above describe many metrics that can help determine a university's ranking, such as peer opinion, international score, citations, employer reputation, and visibility. However, they group these topics into one of two categories: research and education. Anowar et al. show that the three other scores we have (citation, international outlook, and industry outcome) can be grouped in with the other two scores. Citation and industry outcome can be added to the research score with high weightage, while the international outlook can be added to the research score with a smaller weightage."

    "Based on that paper, we can start looking at other possible questions to answer. Firstly, how can we incorporate some of our metrics, such as citation score and industry outcome score, into current variables, such as research score? This can possibly be done using a weighted average, but we would need to explore how to weigh it fairly. If we are able to do so, we can simplify our model further, as there would be less parameters. Another question is, if we were to use some of the ommited metrics, such as location, could we create a new, more accurate model? We could possibly group each country in the `location` column by continent, and possibly explore trends (are North America schools higher rated than Africa schools, for example)."

    "One way that our model could potentially be improved is exploring interaction terms. Although it would not make much sense in the context, we can explore how different interaction terms between variables would fit into our model. If there is a benefit to adding them, we would have a more accurate model. Looking at figure 3, the pairwise plot, we can see that some of the variables, such as the citations score, have a non-linear relationship with overall score. It would be beneficial to account for this by applying a transformation in the variable. Doing so would increase the linearity in the model. We would have to experiment to see what transformation would be the best for the model."
